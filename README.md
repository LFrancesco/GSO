This code was written by the authors of "Gumbel-softmax-based Optimization: A Simple General Framework for Optimization Problems on Graphs". 

Our implementation is in PyTorch. The graphs used in the experiments are included as well. 
Since we haven't worked on integration of our code, you may find part of the code are in .py while the others are in Jupyter Notebook. 
And many of them may not be the exact same version of experiments in our paper since we've tried other attempts afterwards. 

You are welcome to make possible improvements based on these code.
